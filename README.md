# Hyperexponential as an alternative Long Tail distribution

In this project I will add the hyperexponentials to a comparision of the better distribution to fit long tail movement data. 
This is a classical problem of random search, with applications like patterns of search used by robots and humam movement patterns. 
Here I will focus in the problem of animal movement, more specific in the distributions of step lengths of animals. 
For animal movement the distribution that has been the most popular for having a good fit for diverse animals movement data is the Lévy (Power Law) Distribution.
This fit ability goes along with the classical paper ... from Ghandi, that shows the Lévy distribution as the most efficient distribution 
that an animal could use to find food in scarce enviroment, this paper give origin to the levy flight foraging hypothesis.

During my masters studies I showed by numerical and analytical methods, that hyperexponentials are more efficient than Lévy distributions. We find out
that the hyperexponential is more efficient due to an capacity of obtain information about the enviroment after multiple searchs.
With this information the hyperexponential can outperform the Lévy distribution.

In this work our focus is to analyze if hyperexponentials can outperform the fit of levy distributions, with this will be possible to better
understand search mechanisms used by animals. Understanding search mechanism is
